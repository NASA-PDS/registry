# PDS API Search Query Lexer

This repository contains the resources to create a Java JAR library to parse the [Planetary Data System](https://pds.nasa.gov/)'s [API](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pds-api) search queries.

It's based on the ANTLR4 parser generator. It is, for example, used in the [pds-api-service](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pds-api-service)'s Elasticsearch branch.
