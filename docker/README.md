With the use of above profiles the docker compose can start components individually
or as a group of components as follows. The `-d` option at the end of the commands is used to
run containers in detached mode (Run containers in the background).

```
docker compose --profile=pds-core-registry up -d

docker compose --profile=dev-api up
```

For test, start the registry with some test data loaded:

    docker compose --profile=int-registry-batch-loader up


For API dev, start the registry with some test data, without the API:

    docker compose --profile=dev-api up

In addition, the following wrapper scripts available in the `registry/docker` directory can be used to easily execute
some docker compose services.

| Script Usage | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `./int-test.sh` | This script is a wrapper to execute Postman integration tests with docker compose. Please note that the test data should be already available in Elasticsearch. If it is required to load test data before executing the integration test, then use the `int-registry-batch-loader` docker compose profile or `int-registry-service-loader` docker compose profile, as explained in this README file. |
| `./pds-batch-loader.sh <harvest_job_config_file_path>` | This script is a wrapper to run the registry loader with docker compose, while passing a Harvest job configuration file as an argument. |
| `./pds-service-loader.sh <harvest_job_config_file_path>` | This script is a wrapper to run the registry-harvest-cli with docker compose, while passing a Harvest job configuration file as an argument. |

## üèÉ Quick start guide - with default configurations

This quick start guide is a quick way to start all Registry Components, load test data and run tests with a Postman
collection. This quick start steps use default configurations such as default username and password.

PLEASE DO NOT use the quick start with default configurations in any environment other than your local machine. Make sure
to replace the default passwords with your own passwords as explained in the following section:
**Steps to configure registry components to be executed with docker compose** to ensure security.

**Steps to quick start all Registry Components, load test data and run tests with a Postman collection**

1) Get the latest copy of the Registry from https://github.com/NASA-PDS/registry.
```
git clone https://github.com/NASA-PDS/registry.git
```
2) Open a terminal and change the current working directory to `registry/docker/certs`.
```
cd docker/certs
```

3) Generate certificates required for OpenSearch by executing the following shell script.
```
./generate-certs.sh
```

4) Change the current working directory to `registry/docker`.
```
cd ..
```

5) Deploy and execute integration tests with the following single command.
```
docker compose --profile=int-registry-service-loader up
```
Note: This may take several minutes, including data loading  delays between components.

6) To clean the deployment, execute the following command.
```
docker compose --profile=int-registry-service-loader down
```


## üèÉ Steps to configure registry components to be executed with docker compose

#### 1. Open the `.env` file (located in the same directory with the `docker.compose.yml` file).

#### 2. Check and update (if necessary) the following environment variables related with Elasticsearch.

#### 3. Check and update (if necessary) the `elasticSearch.host` property in the `config/application.properties` file.

Make sure this `application.properties` file is up-to-date with the latest changes in the Registry API service. It is recommended to
get a copy of `application.properties` from the latest code of the Registry API service
([registry-api-service/tree/main/src/main/resources](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/registry-api-service/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.properties))
and replace the `config/application.properties` file with it.

The `elasticSearch.host` should be set as follows. The host name used below should match with the Elasticsearch service
name used in the `docker-compose.yml`.

```
elasticSearch.host=elasticsearch:9200
```

#### 4. Check and update (if necessary) the following environment variables related with the Registry API.

## üèÉ Steps to execute registry components with docker compose

#### 1. Open a terminal and change the current working directory to `registry/docker`.

#### 2. Start the backend services (both Elasticsearch and the Registry API) as follows.

```
docker compose --profile=pds-core-registry up -d
```

When above command is executed, the Registry API will wait for Elasticsearch to start.

Alternatively, it is possible to start only Elasticsearch as follows (see the table with profiles and components above).

```
docker compose --profile=dev-api up -d
```

#### 3. Execute the Registry Loader as follows.

```
docker compose --profile=pds-batch-loader up
```

When above command is executed, the Registry Loader will use the configurations and data provided with the following
environment variables configured in the `.env` file.
```
* HARVEST_JOB_CONFIG_FILE
* HARVEST_DATA_DIR
```

Alternatively, it is possible to execute the Registry Loader with test data and integration tests as follows.
```
docker compose --profile=int-registry-batch-loader up
```

When above command is executed, the Registry Loader will download test data from URL configured with the following
environment variable  in the `.env` file.
```
* TEST_DATA_URL
```

Wait for the following message in the terminal to make sure if the execution of the Registry Loader exited with code 0.
```
docker-reg-api-integration-1 exited with code 0
```

#### 4. Test the deployment.

Follow the instructions in the following sections at the end of the [Test Your Deployment](https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds-registry-app/install/test.html).

* Query Elasticsearch
* Use Registry API

Note that the Registry API is published to port 8080 as `http` and‚Äîwhen not using the `dev-api` profile‚Äîto port 8443 as `https` (with a self-signed certificate) on all host interfaces.

## üèÉ Cleaning up the Registry Loader deployment

#### * The Registry Loader can be cleaned up as follows.

```
docker compose --profile=pds-batch-loader down
```

Note: Ignore any `failed to remove network` errors, because the related docker network
has active endpoints of other services.
